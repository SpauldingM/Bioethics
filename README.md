## Ethics Addendum:

Protocol Approval & Rules

All research activities relating to the use of BCI must be reviewed and approved by the campus’s review board or ethics committee before the data collection can begin. 
A designated member of the faculty must be present to oversee all phases of the project to ensure compliance with ethical and safety standards
Testee and laboratory safety training is required to be completed before any of the project begins
If the study requires neurofeedback or any other effects that involve the health of the testees, a qualified medical professional must be listed as a safety consultant and present until the end.
Unless approved by the committee or review board, only the use of commercially available and non-invasive devices will be permitted.

Informed Consent
Purpose: The goal of this study is to analyze if someone can multitask while using a BCI device
Procedures: Those who sign up will be wearing headsets then prompted to either answer questions or respond to prompts that appear on a screen while also the tester will ask questions of their own to study not only the use of the BCI but also how someone reacts in this situation.
Risk: There will most likely be the risks of headaches, dizziness, discomfort or fatigue, though a licensed medical staff will be present for the testing.
If the participants do not feel comfortable with going on with the testing, they’re welcomed to drop out at any time by reaching out to the lead investigator of the program at 740-603-1234. They may also reach out to ask any questions they may have regarding the program.

Scope
Researchers will not be testing the BCI’s on themselves unless it is pre-approved and following the required necessities for testing. (Supervised, medical staffed. For example.)
Use of the BCI’s will only be permitted and used on campus
Only devices that were approved by the committee or review board will be used during testing and there will be no modifications to the interface that alter the configurations beyond what has been approved.
Violations will result in the termination of the program

Data Handling
The only information that will be gathered during this study will be what is essential for the study’s purpose.
Once the necessary information has been collected, it will be encrypted and securely stored in a repository where only authorized personnel can access the information.
These authorized personnel will be limited to the committee and the researcher of this study
All information will be kept for a maximum of three years before it is deleted and not in the university’s possession unless the information is requested for investigation. Once it is no longer required, it will then be expunged.

Incident & Withdrawal Process
Testing will immediately cease if the participant begins experiencing symptoms such as discomfort, dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness or if they request to stop.
Any reaction, whether physical or psychological, will be reported to the committee or review board within 24 hours of the event occurring
If a participant decides to withdraw from the study, their data will be removed from the system to prevent any risk of personal information being leaked.

## Equity & Access Analysis:
The ones that would benefit from a BCI based setting would be the ones who would feel comfortable with the monitoring and the presence of a device on themselves or would be able to afford the technology if they were permitted to purchase their own, providing them with the chance to receive personalized support. Though the ones who aren't comfortable with it, disabled or limited to the access of such technology will most likely be at a loss if the presence of BCI's becomes a mandatory thing. A situation like this would create a divide between the two groups, unless the school that was looking into this were able to afford access for those who can't. The policy should also guarantee that this participation is voluntary and not mandatory or alternatives would be provided.

## Justification:
In Chapter 12, The principles of autonomy, beneficence and justice require that technology doesn't compromise one's personal freedom or fairness on the path of enhancing the future of society's well being. These principles mean that BCI can be used not only consensually but beneficial. In chapter 13, new technology tends to create an effect upon society where some people will have access to it before others will, leading to innovation unintentionally reinforcing inequality. Calling for a way to not only protect the participants from harm but also to ensure that progress can be beneficial to everyone, even if they don't have the privilege.

## Reflection:
Looking back, The one trade off I would revisit would be between innovation and privacy. BCI and other neurological devices can most certainly provide valuable information when it comes to healthcare or benefiting those in the classroom, but it may also reveal personal information that may not be consented. Limits should be placed on not only data retention but also how a third party would use that information.
